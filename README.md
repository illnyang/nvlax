<p align="center">Future-proof NvENC & NvFBC patcher</p>

# Requirements
- Working internet connection during configuration (i.e cloning does NOT include dependencies)
- CMake
- C++ compiler

# Building

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/illnyang/nvlax.git'
cd nvlax
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Protip: use WSL if you're using Windows.

# Example of usage

## Patch NvENC in-place:

```bash
Linux:
# nvlax_encode -i /usr/lib/libnvidia-encode.so.495.44 -o /usr/lib/libnvidia-encode.so.495.44
Windows:
# nvlax_encode -i nvEncodeAPI64.dll -o nvEncodeAPI64.dll
# nvlax_encode -i nvEncodeAPI.dll -o nvEncodeAPI.dll
```
## Patch NvFBC in-place:

```bash
Linux:
# nvlax_fbc -i /usr/lib/libnvidia-fbc.so.495.44 -o /usr/lib/libnvidia-fbc.so.495.44
```

# FAQ

#### How is this more future-proof?
This patcher performs assembly-level heuristics instead of naive pattern-matching. The patching itself works more/less the same way as in [keylase/nvidia-patch](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch).

#### Which driver versions are supported?
I have tested this patcher against the following versions (on Linux):

   - 470.74
   - 495.29.05
   - 495.44
   - 495.46 (tested by @cybik)

It *should* work on previous versions as well. Please don't open-up new issues if you're using ancient drivers, thanks.

#### Windows support?
`nvlax_encode` accepts NVIDIA DLLs as input files. NvFBC patching is not supported yet, though.
